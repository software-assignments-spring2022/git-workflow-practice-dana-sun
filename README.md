[DeepMind has made software writing AI that rivals average human coder](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2306820-deepmind-has-made-software-writing-ai-that-rivals-average-human-coder/)

## Why I find this article interesting

These machines were determined to be able to write code better than some humans when they performed better than the average human programmer when judged in competition. This is the first time an AI code-writing system competed at this level of performance in contest, which I think this is really impressive. If computers are growing more and more capable of coding at the level of a standard human, I wonder if this would affect the job industry just yet, and just how expensive this technology is. I also wonder how far it's going to improve, if even. It's a very big step for the world of AI and it could open further doors to the future of technology.

It's definitely impressive and jarring to see that AI has been developed to before better than the average programmer. However, I think there are still several advantages of having a human be a programmer. In scrum teams, for example, being able to collaborate with others is definitely an advantage and arguably increases the efficiency of development more so than an automated AI programmer.

## Mateus Silva Aragao (aragaomateus) Comments:
That's a very interesting article, and I believe that we should look into it not only from the AI standpoint but also on how this can affect our trade (software engineering). I feel that that is a glimpse of automation penetrating, even more, the field of a software engineer. Those that used to drive the automation that caused the displacement of jobs now are poised to suffer from the same devil. 
I don't think that this is harmful, but I believe that this is the opportunity for us to focus on skills that can not yet be reproduced by AI. Knowing how to ask the right questions,  solving larger problems, and teamwork required for building large apps are still intrinsic to humans and will continue to for a long time.
